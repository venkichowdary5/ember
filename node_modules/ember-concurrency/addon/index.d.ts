 * property becomes truthy. If you provide a callback, it'll be called

 * times thereafter whenever the property changes, until you return

 * in which case the task will continue executing when the property's
 * value becomes the value that you passed in.

 * import { task, waitForProperty } from 'ember-concurrency';
