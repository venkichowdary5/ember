The Boy Scouts of America and the Sacramento Tree Foundation, in partnership with the Bureau of Reclamation, planted 100 trees at Reclamation\u2019s CCAO near Folsom Dam in celebration of the Boy Scouts\u2019 100th anniversary. The trees, which were donated by the Sacramento Tree Foundation through a grant from Sacramento Municipal Utility District, will promote the enhancement and restoration of vegetation in the area. The majority of the trees were planted surrounding the American River Water Education Center, which focuses on water conservation and features a water-efficient landscape. The Scouts were also recognized as participants in Take Pride in America\u00ae, a nationwide partnership program authorized by Congress to promote the appreciation and stewardship of our nation\u2019s public lands. This project is part of an effort at CCAO to promote the preservation of natural resources and ecosystems on Reclamation project lands and to manage lands in a way that enhances conditions for fish, wildlife, land and cultural resources.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n",

The cleanup work is being funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and ties into the Department of the Interior\u2019s \u201cYouth in the Great Outdoors\u0022 initiative to employ, educate and engage young people from all backgrounds in exploring, connecting with and preserving America\u2019s natural and cultural heritage.\r\n\r\nIn hard hats and safety glasses, the three women and 16 men are cleaning up tons of debris left by previous concession contractors. Much of it is composed of old concrete-filled tires that had been used years ago to build retaining walls to keep the lake\u2019s hillsides from sliding into the water. Although a recently acquired jackhammer helps, the crew continues to break up the concrete using only sledgehammers.\r\n\r\nA state agency created by Gov. Jerry Brown in July 1976, the CCC is the oldest and largest state conservation corps program in the nation. The program hires young adults for a year of service that includes natural-resource and emergency-response work to help them become stronger workers, citizens and individuals. Modeled after the original federal Civilian Conservation Corps created in 1933 by President Franklin Roosevelt, some 110,000 young people have joined the CCC since 1976, with about 3,000 hired annually.\r\n\r\nThe corps members help not only the public by their work, they help themselves by learning new skills and advancing their education: Since 2008, more than 4,000 CCC members have earned their high-school diplomas, and many then continued their schooling using either the CCC Scholarship or the Corps Networks AmeriCorps Education Award. When Berryessa crew members were asked what they would be doing if they weren\u2019t in the CCC, their answers ranged from unloading trucks to working customer-service jobs to playing video games.\r\n\r\nThe CCC members on the job at Lake Berryessa \u2013 differentiated by their hat color (blue for corps members, green for specialists, red for crew leaders, and yellow for supervisors) \u2013 are Monet Allen, Cruz Castro, Daniel Davidson, Fred Freeman, Alexandrea Henderson, John Lenhard, Justin Leon, Dereck Loring, Joshua Musgray, Patrick Perry, Michael Peterson, Mason Rising, Shiffon Rollins, Ruben Simi, Dantrell Stevens, Miles Stranzl, Jeff Taggart, Justen Tatum and Daniel White.

C.A.S.T., which stands for Catch a Special Thrill, offers children with disabilities or socioeconomic disadvantages an opportunity to enjoy a day of fishing. This year, the four key principles of the Let\u0027s Move Outside! initiative, a component of the first lady\u0027s Let\u0027s Move campaign, became the focal point of the day. \r\n\r\nDeputy Assistant Secretary for Water and Science John Tubbs came out from Washington to support the Let\u0027s Move Outside! emphasis on health, family, fun, and stewardship. \r\n\r\n\u0022We\u0027ve got about a hundred volunteers out here with kids from the Phoenix area enjoying a great day of fishing here on beautiful Lake Pleasant. We\u0027re getting people outdoors, in America\u0027s Great Outdoors. I\u0027m just happy to be here and be a part of it,\u0022 Tubbs said from a speedboat piloted by Reclamation\u0027s Phoenix area manager Randy Chandler. They were accompanied by David Modeer, general manager of the Central Arizona Project. No trouble finding kids reeling in those fish \u2013 the large-mouth bass were biting this year!\r\n\r\nWhile the participating children were out fishing, their families enjoyed a casting practice experience on shore and lessons on stewardship from Liberty Wildlife, a local organization that rehabilitates injured wild birds. \r\n\r\nThis year\u0027s C.A.S.T. for Kids event emphasized good nutrition and healthy food choices by offering fruit, raw vegetables to snack on, and a turkey-burger option at lunch. Recipe cards for healthy foods that are fun to make and fun to eat were included in the participating children\u0027s goody-bags, along with rules for outdoor games the whole family could enjoy. \r\n\r\n\u0022I saw a lot of big smiles on kids\u0027 faces and a lot of big fish, too,\u0022 Tubbs said, speaking at the awards ceremony during which each child receives a plaque and a trophy. \u0022It was great to see people happy, enjoying the water and the weather. I want to thank all the volunteers and the boat captains today. This is a great opportunity to get outside and enjoy the water and our great outdoors.\u0022 He added, \u0022I\u0027ll be sure to bring back word to the assistant secretary about what a fantastic event this is.\u0022\r\n\r\nThis year\u0027s event allowed 37 children with disabilities or who are socioeconomically disadvantaged to spend a morning out on the lake, courtesy of volunteers from the Arizona Bass Federation. Their safety was ensured by the Arizona Game and Fish Department and the Coast Guard Auxiliary. The event could not take place without the cooperation and contributions of the Central Arizona Water Conservation District and Maricopa County Parks and Recreation, which manages the recreational facilities at the lake, formed by New Waddell Dam on the Central Arizona Project, through an agreement with Reclamation. \r\n\r\nThe C.A.S.T. for Kids fishing event at Lake Pleasant is hosted by the Bureau of Reclamation\u0027s Phoenix Area office; Steve Johnson is the coordinator. Cooperating agencies include the Arizona Bass Federation; Arizona Game and Fish Department; Central Arizona Project; Coast Guard Auxiliary; Liberty Wildlife; and the Maricopa County Parks and Recreation Department. Children are referred from the Paradise Valley Unified School District Special Olympics; Quality Care Network; and the Vineyard Church of North Phoenix.\r\n\r\nSponsors donate fishing equipment (including worms) and provide food, items for goody bags, trophies, exhibits and everything needed to make the day enjoyable for all involved. This year\u0027s sponsors included: Arizona Bass Federation; Baker Wee Bakery;  Bill Johnson\u0027s Restaurants; Central Arizona Project, President\u0027s Award for Community Service; Coca-Cola Enterprises; Shamrock Foods Co.; Dairy Maid Foods; First Credit Union; Fry\u0027s Food Stores; Salt River Solar \u0026 Wind LLC; and Sav-On Fence Co.\r\n\r\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.castforkids.org\/\u0022 target=\u0022_new\u0022\u003EC.A.S.T. for Kids Foundation\u003C\/a\u003E was formed in 1991 to join volunteers who love to fish with children who are disabled and disadvantaged children for a day of fishing in the outdoors.
